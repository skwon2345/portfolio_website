# Website Development Using React and Flask

- Website URL: <https://master.djdo0jrrbxwf7.amplifyapp.com>

## OverView
This project is a simple web framework project that can introduce my on-going and finished projects to any possible employers.
It also has some functionalities that can interact with users, such as digit classification, recieve a drawn digit by any users and answer what was the digit that was drawns by the user, and downloadable reports that are created daily based on real chart data, financial statements, and latest related news. (Stock Markets that are analyzed by my program are KOSPI, and KOSDAQ which are two biggest markets in South Korea.)

## Main Functions
1. Daily Stock Analysis Reports (using 3rd party api)
2. Digit Classification (SVM Model)
3. Contact Form (used Firestore to store message data)
4. Documents Pagination (Not Done Yet)

## Structure
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Python
- Framework: Flask
- Database: Firestore
- Frontend Server: AWS Amplify
- Backedn Server: Google gcloud

## Goal
I started this project to extend my frontend programming skills that fully interacts with backend without any network issues. Also, I collects daily stock reports written by my program, and save all reports data to cloud database in order to use them as fuel to my deep learning stock program that will be done later.

## Achievenments
- Learned structure of React, how to deploy the website, how data is passed by each class, and which default React functions are called when rendering a page.
- Learned creating automatic documents, using scheduler to schedule what time to write report daily, api usage, some simple deep learning algorithm using python.
- Learned creating api using Flask, and HTTP Server Requests (GET, POST).
- Learned how to upload, update, delete data in document-oriented database using Firestore.
- Learned how to commit code to github.
- Learned how to crawl website that are loaded dynamically using Selenium, and BeautifulSoup.
